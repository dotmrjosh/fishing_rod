# Fishing Rod

An asset extractor to recover assets from games made with the SakanaGL engine (by CyberStep).

> This project was built for the sole purpose of preserving art and assets from the mobile game [Tomotoru](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223131659/https://www.tomotoru.com/) so all the parsing is built around the version of the engine in Tomotoru. This means newer games built with the SakanaGL engine may not be compatible with this tool.
